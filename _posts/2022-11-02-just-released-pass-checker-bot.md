title:  "Just released passChecker bot"
---

Wanna check if your passwords are secure and have not been previously disclosed? <br><br> Just released the **passCheckerbot**, which is a Telegram bot which searches over a +60GB disclosed password database in less than a moment providing a simple answer "This password has [NOT] been disclosed". Moreover it allows two modes (one of them a private mode):
1. Verify the raw password.
1. Verify a SHA1 hashed password.
